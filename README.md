# Translator

Created a English to Japanese Language translator using seq2seq and attention architecture.

The input, English language sentences, are tokenized into words and target, Japanese language sentences are tokenized into a character.
A token of Japanese language can be a Hiragana or a Katagana or a kanji character.
